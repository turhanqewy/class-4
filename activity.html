<h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
<p>
    Dogs are incredibly intelligent and loyal animals, known for their strong bond with humans that dates back over 15,000 years. They can understand hundreds of words and gestures, and each dog’s nose print is as unique as a human fingerprint. With around 300 million scent receptors, their sense of smell is thousands of times more sensitive than ours. Dogs dream during sleep, wag their tails to express emotion, and even release oxytocin—the “love hormone”—when interacting with people. From speedy Greyhounds to tiny Chihuahuas, their diversity is as impressive as their devotion.
